Implement simple gradient descent for linear regression.
You will have a simple dataset containing m=? points, you should implement a simple gradient decent in Python to calculate best fit for the hypnosis function. These examples are taken from Week 1 in Machine Learning course for Andrew Ng.
Your dataset is in this folder, named dataset.csv

your Hypnosis function
![h(x)=theta0 + theta1 * x](hypnosis.png)

Your cost function
![J(theta0, theta1) = (1/2*m)*sum "from 1 to m" of ((h(x subscript i) - y)^2)](cost_function.png)

Gradient Descent

*You don't need to train a model or anything just pure math.
*Your output should be theta0 and theta1, and a plot of the model.
*You should only use python standard library except matplotlib.
*If you find anything hard, you can revise the video associated with it in the course, then in Discord.
